//! Name normalization applied before any typosquat signal compares a
//! candidate against the popular-package dataset.
//!
//! # Case
//!
//! npm package names are lowercase, so [`normalize_name`] lowercases a
//! candidate before it is scored. `React` is therefore compared as `react`
//! (and reported as an exact match, not a one-edit typo).
//!
//! # Scoped names
//!
//! An npm scoped name (`@scope/name`) has two independent parts. A raw
//! Levenshtein distance over the whole string lets edits cross the `/`
//! boundary and compares a scope against a bare name, which gives misleading
//! results. [`split_npm_name`] separates the two parts, and [`name_distance`]
//! compares them pairwise:
//!
//! - both scoped: scope-to-scope distance plus name-to-name distance, so
//!   `@typess/node` vs `@types/node` is 1 (scope) + 0 (name);
//! - both unscoped: plain distance between the bare names;
//! - one scoped and one not: plain distance over the full strings. The `@`
//!   and `/` alone keep such pairs far apart, so they rarely land inside the
//!   scanner's threshold. Dropping a scope (`types-node`) is handled by the
//!   separate scope-confusion signal instead.
